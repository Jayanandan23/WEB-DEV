<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<p>Established in 2014, the Department of Computer Applications is committed to providing quality education in the field of computer science. We currently offer a three-year undergraduate Bachelor of Computer Application (BCA) course, equipping students with the necessary skills to thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology.

Our department boasts a team of experienced faculty members who are dedicated to nurturing students into software professionals with a strong sense of social commitment, leadership, and dedication. With their guidance and expertise, students gain a solid foundation in computer applications and are prepared to meet the challenges of the industry.

To support practical learning, we have a well-equipped software lab with 30 computers. Our classrooms and labs are equipped with state-of-the-art information and communication technology (ICT) facilities, enabling students to engage in hands-on learning and stay abreast of the latest industry tools and trends. The software lab is equipped with a wide range of software applications, ensuring that students can effectively grasp the concepts outlined in the syllabus.

At our department, we believe in holistic development and industry readiness. To achieve this, we regularly organize workshops, seminars, and boot camps that focus on equipping students with industry-ready skills. We collaborate with experts to provide training in mathematical aptitude and soft skills, partnering with the college's placement cell to enhance students' employability. Additionally, we conduct seminars and training programs using Learning Management Systems (LMS) to prepare students for higher studies and academic excellence. We have also established Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with reputed institutes to foster academic and industry linkages, ensuring our students have access to a well-rounded educational experience.

We encourage our students to engage in extracurricular activities to foster personal growth and develop well-rounded personalities. Understanding the significance of hands-on training in acquiring IT skills, we encourage students to undertake software projects beyond their curriculum. To impart industry-ready skills, we conduct regular sessions and meetups in emerging fields such as Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Internet of Things, and Cyber Security. Furthermore, we provide support for entrepreneurship and offer incubation facilities through our college's Innovation and Entrepreneurship Development Centre (IEDC), empowering students to pursue their entrepreneurial aspirations.
